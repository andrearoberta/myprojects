An urban digital twin can be applied to parking vehicles, providing numerous benefits and opportunities for optimizing parking management and enhancing urban mobility. In particular, a digital urban parking can facilitate efficient management of parking spaces. It can monitor occupancy levels, detect unauthorized parking, and identify vehicles that have overstayed their allotted time. This information can be used to optimize parking enforcement efforts and ensure fair use of parking resources. In order to optimize this there is a need to use constraints The provided model represents a parking allocation problem where the goal is to allocate vehicles to parking spaces in a grid layout. We'll consider optimizing the allocation of parking spaces in a city to minimize congestion and maximize the utilization of available spaces. More precisely, the rationale is for vehicles to occupy the center parking spaces first and then the side parking spaces.
